# configuration
As of right now, I use both VsCode, PyCharm and the terminal depending on my mood. That being said, I always use vim so I can type super fast. 

# Themes
See the themes in the `fonts-themes.md` file.

# PyCharm
I use NeoVim extension.

# VsCode
Use default Vim extension.

# Vim
I use vim everywhere, I customize vim more for the terminal, and leave it default for PyCharm and VScode. In terminal, I use the default vim (not neovim).
The .vimrc configuration file can be found in this repository

2. Install Windows Terminal
